#Python Tuples
#A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a
#number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within
#parenthesis.
#The main difference between lists and tuples is- Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and
#their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) )
#sand cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists. 

friends = ('Prathamesh','Nitin','Santosh','Minal','Nawaz','Mrunali')

#Print Tuples
print(friends)

#All same operation like on List
