#Python Dictionary
#Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like associative arrays or
#hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any
#Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any
#arbitrary Python object.Python 3
#Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed
#using square braces ([]).

#Empyt Dictionary
dict = {}


dict['one'] = 'This is one'

dict[2] = 'This is two'

#Print Dictionary
print(dict)

#All same operation like on List

#Print only Keys
print(dict.keys())

#Print only Values
print(dict.values())
